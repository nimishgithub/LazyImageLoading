# LazyImageLoading
A little gig for demonstrating how to lazily load images or anything form the internet while giving a nice user experience. Feel free to reuse it!


Release Notes:
1. Flickr search API integration.
2. Flickr image loading API integration.
3. Asynchronous & lazy Image loading via download manager.
4. Image caching mechanism using NSCache and NSOperation Queue.

Suggested Enhancements:
1. Handle cases when no image is found for the given search.
2. Detail page when user taps on an image.
3. Implementation of activity indicator.


.......... NOTE ...........
I created this small gig because I believe I have a pretty good understanding of how NSOperationQueues work, also I have worked on a couple of projects that required similar kind of intrictae solution implement downloading functionality. Whosoever uses this project can take the reference about how NSOperationQueues can be use to download stuff from the internet while giving  nice user experience. The code is free to use and take reference from. I hope it helps somebody :)
